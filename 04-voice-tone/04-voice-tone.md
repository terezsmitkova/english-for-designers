## Is copying a bad thing?

In my opinion, copying is not a bad thing in terms of inspiration. Most graphic designers gather ideas and inspiration from their work. It's about seeing what someone has already created, how someone was thinking. And that can help us move forward in our work. I think that's why that if we like a logo and we are inspired by it, but we put a piece of our work into it, so it's not a bad thing. If we "steal" something, we don't change anything and leave everything the same, and then we publish it as my work. I already consider this a scam. We should avoid this.  I also liked a few design works, but it never occurred to me to steal them. When I imagine that someone spent a lot of time thinking about it and creating it, I would never dare to steal his work. Because if it happened to me, I would go crazy.

## My story 

My experience with copying (stealing) ideas doesn't come from the world of design, but the field of cuisine. My mom owns a cafe. She and I cared about it. We consider her to be our child. However, our business is located in the small town of Teplice, where there are a total of five cafes. So it is difficult not to notice when someone "copies" something from you to their cafeteria. In our cafe, we ​​rely on quality and uniqueness. Unfortunately, about a year ago, we were opened, one of the local business, which has been here for a long time, probably started to envy us and copied our breakfast menu from us. They started preparing it just like us. And that made us very upset. Unfortunately, we couldn't do anything about it. So we had to watch as they served our menu in this cafe. Fortunately, it was almost no success with them, and people prefer to come to us for our breakfast. 
In the end, it all turned out
