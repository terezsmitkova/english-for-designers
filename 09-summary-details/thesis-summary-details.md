### The story – How it all started
I always like traveling around the Czech Republic. Since I was a kid, my parents and I visited lots of castles and chateaus. And we discovered the beauty of our country. When Mr. Jelínek, co-founder of the tourist center VisitTeplice, approached me and asked me if I would like to create a new visual style and marketing communication for the tourist area Teplicko. I said definitely yes and chose this theme for my bachelor thesis.

### Teplicko
Personally, Teplicko is one of the favorite places because I studied at High school, and a majority of my family live here as my brother with family, my grandparents.

This destination is a beautiful tourist spot with a rich history, a range of cultural monuments, relaxation places as parks, gardens, and a beautiful natural environment with a range of forests and mountain peaks. There is the oldest spa in Bohemia, the longest cableway in Europe, and many other fascinating places. In the past, Teplicko was a favorite of people and famous personalities from all over the world. They used to visit the spa and cultural life even during the days when the town of Teplice was still called Little Paris.

### Inspiration first
First, I create research on tourist areas in the Czech Republic. Their visual presentation, marketing communication, and online messages via social networks as Instagram or Facebook. I am interested in the communication of Lipno nad Vltavou. They have their mascot (Mr. Fox) that represented Lipno and lures new tourists, especially families with kids.

Next, that intrigued me is Znojmo city. They have good communication via Instagram. They share posts as reporting from the city. It makes a positive vibe for followings because they are quick information and can become a part of Znojmos communication.

### First drafts

### Design of logo
I called the tourist area Teplicko in marketing and visual communication „in Teplicko.“ This name refers to activities, that happen in Teplice, and the tourist can experience them here. The main principle of the proposed logo is the representation of hiking paths using stencil fonts, which I designed myself. It also contains an arrow representing the direction of indicators encountered in different ways. In the visual style, I have chosen a typical color spectrum (blue, green, red, yellow), which we know from tourist signs and attract our attention well.

I have created two variations of the logo.

- The first variant is more decent, adapted for the older generation because of its better readability. The application is mainly on posters, which serve the older age group mentioned above, which does not use social networks to a large extent.

- The other variant is more creative, lively, and dynamic than the previous proposal. In communication, it focuses on the younger generation, whom it can address with its playfulness. There is a highlighted word pulse that refers to warm springs in Teplice, and at the same time, the arrow in the logo points to activities, that are happening in the area. It is used mainly on social networks and in merchandising.

### Communication
#### The specific form of language
For the tourist region Teplicko, I have created a specific form of communication, which will be its signature, and is written into the visual style. This language is based on humorous and absurd questions about the places and attractions visited here, which amuse and generate interest in finding out more.

#### Mascot
One of the most important communication channels for attracting new tourists (families with children). I created the soft toy mascot Pig Doubravka, based on Doubravka Mountain, where he lives, which is associated with the rumor of finding thermal springs. The pig has an appearance, changes clothes or accessories according to the situation, character, and specific form of language for communication with children.

### Posters
The prints, that can we see on the street every day are called Out of Home. I deal here with the application for posters, banners, and billboards. I've divided these posters into three levels of communication.

- Image posters
- Information posters
- Two posters - – question and answer

### Online
In the context of online communication, I focus primarily on the target group, which is the young generation and families with children through the social networks Instagram and Facebook.

I have identified several communication planes that present the tourist area Tepliceko as an interesting place for holidays even for young age groups. I also created the hashtag #nateplicku, which is typical of Instagram, under which people can add posts and show off their photos.

- Funny posts
- Posts of events
- Posts - Tips for trips
- Posts of Pig Doubravka
- Filter of Doubravka on Instagram

### Merchadising
I have designed several gift items for the right tourist enthusiasts, that they can take home as souvenirs from their vacation in the north of Bohemia. The visual style is written into them to match the overall design of the tourist area, and these gifts have become another distinguishing signal of Teplicko.
